## ABSTRACT
Smart Mirror gives user an interface to virtually try the clothes of his/her choice. It is like a virtual trial room, where the person can try on the clothes virtually. Thereâ€™s also a separate interface for voice recognition which also triggers certain actions when user speaks some specific commands. Kinect Sensor (v1) is used to detect body gestures, skeleton points and also for voice recognition. Visual Studio is used for front end interface.
## SETUP
Install SDK v1.8 and Microsoft Visual Studio. Make sure that Kinect is not plugged and Visual Studio is closed during installation. Connect Kinect v1 to your PC and the drivers will be installed automatically. Now, open SkeletalTracking.sln and run the file for trial room interface. Open KinectAudioDemo.sln and run the file for voice recognition interface.
## APPLICATIONS
Smart Mirror gives user the facility of trying on the clothes virtually (without putting them on
) and the person can then purchase the desired clothes of appropriate size. All has one to do is to give simple gestures to select clothes. It can be installed in outlets, acting as virtual trial rooms. It can also be used for manufacturing companies to determine in which colours a cloth of a particular design is to be produced. 
## REQUIREMENTS
1.	XBOX Kinect v1

## LIBRARIES USED
Windows SDK v1.8
## ABOUT
Kinect is a line of motion sensing input device produced by Microsoft. It uses video camera to extract coordinates of joints of our body. It can even recognise voice and body gestures. It has also IR sensor and depth sensor.
Visual Studio Code is an integrated development environment from Microsoft. It is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications. It is also used for front end interface.

## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
The image superimposition is 2D. An approach should be made to make 3D virtual trial room. Further, the superimposed image can be trained to fit the person (using GAN). The voice recognition part should be integrated within the trial room interface so that user can select clothes either through body gestures or voice command.
